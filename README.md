## BDD Specs

### Story: User requests to see the Movies

### Narrative #1

```
As a user
I want the app to automatically load the latest movies
So I can know what are the latest movies
```

### Scenarios (Acceptance criteria)
```
Given the user has connectivity
When the user requests to see the latest movies
Then the app should display the latest movies from remote
And replace the cached movies with new movies
```
